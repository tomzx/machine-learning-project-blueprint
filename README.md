# Machine Learning Project Blueprint
This repository is an attempt at creating a common project structure for machine learning projects. The purpose is to make it easier for others to rapidly consume and understand your project and its results and to determine if it can be useful for their own project.

The structure contains the following:

```
.
├── checkpoints: storage location for the weights of trained models.
├── data: store data used to train/test the models you've built.
├── logs: store various logs such as training results or any debugging/log information.
├── models: source code of various models that have been tested against the problem you are trying to tackle.
├── utils: utility functions that might be used within your models or when you convert your raw data into data that can be fed to the model.
├── evaluate.py: load your data, load your model and evaluate their performance against the provided data.
├── generate.py: convert raw data from the data folder into data expected by your models.
├── requirements.txt: pip requirements to run your code.
└── train.py: load your data, setup your model(s) and train these model(s) against the provided data.
```
